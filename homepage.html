	<p>
		There are different ways to prevent water pollution from happening that could be a great contribution to the Sustainable 
		Development Goals (SDG's). First solution would be, for the government to implement strict rules to people who uses or 
		touch the marine lives such as corals. Second, investing and helping people improve their maintenance towards the water to 
		clean up faster and help more areas. Lastly would be spreading awareness and joining cleanup assembly by different organizations 
		to help and pursue people into helping and be advocates.
