        <h2>IMPACTS OF WATER POLLUTION</h2>

        <p class="a">
            Water pollution is a major global issue that has
            far-reaching consequences. Studies show that a large
            number of the world's water bodies are affected by
            pollution. 
			Like many developing nations, the Philippines
            faces significant water pollution challenges. Across the
            archipelago, water bodies are deteriorating due to
            rapid urban growth, industrial activities, and
            inadequate waste management systems.
